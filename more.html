                    <h2>Education should be for all.</h2>
                    <p>Education is not a privilege but a human right, because it is a much powerful sector for lifting individuals out of 
                        poverty, narrowing inequality, and promohoting human dignity and development. It is the foundation upon which all other
                        rights are built, making each person a pillar of our cohesiveness as a society. </p>
                    <p>However, despite the importance of education, many children around the world are still denied access to quality education due to
                        various barriers such as poverty, discrimination, and conflict. This is a violation of their basic human rights and has 
                        long-term consequences for their future prospects and well-being.</p>
                    <p>In here, let us see the real situation of education around the world, and see how it greatly affects people, especially children.</p>

                    <p>The world cannot act on its own right now, it needs your help.</p>
                    <p>Through this, each of one can be not just an advocate of education,
                        but also human development, dignity, and sustainability.

                that millions of children are still out of school, and many more are not receiving the quality education they deserve.
                This is a call to action for all of us to work towards ensuring that every child has access to quality education, regardless
                of their background or circumstances.
