            <p class="art">After seeing how education is severely affected by different factors, it's now our turn to 
                contribute to the solution.</p>
            <p class="art"> Project Illuminare aims to share the situation of education around the world, and how each 
                of us can help in making education accessible to all.
            </p>
            <p class="art">This crisis is a slow-motion catastrophe.</p>
            <p class="art"> The lack of quality education translates into diminished human potential, dragging down global economic growth and innovation. </p>
            <p class="art"> It fuels social instability by worsening inequality, undermining public health efforts, and 
                eroding the foundational skills needed for an effective society. </p>
            <p class="art">With this, we must recognize the real problem. The failure to equip our students with
                the necessary skills and knowledge not only hampers individual growth but also stifles societal progress.

            <h2>SO, WHAT CAN WE DO?</h2>
            <p class="ex">Organize volunteer networks of retired teachers, university students, and 
                professionals to provide <span>free, high-quality tutoring and homework assistance.</span> This directly addresses 
                the learning crisis by supplementing school resources and giving extra help to marginalized students, 
                ensuring effective learning.
            </p>
            <p class="ex">Launch <span>fundraising drives</span> that focuses on particular sectors of education,
                like infrastructure, books, materials, and many more. This can include, but not limited to supplying 
                computers and reliable internet for digital literacy training, and building disability-sensitive, 
                separate sanitation facilities to support the attendance of all students.
            </p>
            <p class="ex">Advocacy: <span>affordable and flexible education programs</span> that teach different 
                skills, like technical, vocational, digital, etc.This promotes the "lifelong learning opportunities 
                for all" target, empowering people who missed out on formal education to secure decent 
                work and contribute to economic growth.
